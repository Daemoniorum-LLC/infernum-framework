//! Request handlers.
//!
//! This module re-exports handlers from the server module for organizational purposes.
//! All handlers are implemented directly in server.rs to keep them close to the routing logic.

// Handlers are implemented in server.rs alongside the routing configuration.
// This module exists for future expansion if handler logic grows complex enough
// to warrant separate organization.
